**Welcome**

I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne.
As part of my role, I currently sit as the Director for Undergraduate Studies in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and as the Assistant Dean (Global Engagement) in the Faculty of Science. 
My main area of discipline research lays in the intersection of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science through the study of algorithms and parameters related to  homomorphisms and colourings on graphs, oriented graphs and edge-coloured graphs. 
Though from time to time I get pulled in to other research areas, such as discrete-time processes and education policy and practice.

In recent years I find myself spending most of my time on various projects supporting the work of the university, particularly projects related to curriculum, academic careers and university governance.
