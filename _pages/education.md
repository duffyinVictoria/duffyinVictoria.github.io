Beyond teaching students mathematical facts and ideas, I am particularly interested in how subject design, assessment practices, and learning environments shape students’ sense of belonging and their capacity to develop confidence and independence.
For this end I try, wherever possible, to provide students with broader context about the practice and culture of mathematics and how the idea of *thinking like a mathematician* can be of use to them not only learning mathematics, but in their time at University and beyond. As of the end of 2025, I have lectured into 14 different subjects in mathematics, reaching more than 6500 students across three universities.

In addition to contributions to curriculum design and classroom teaching, I regularly contribute to education-related professional development offerings and offerings for graduate researchers interested in an academic career.
